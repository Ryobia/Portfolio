# Portfolio
My own personal portfolio where I show off what I've done and provide my contact info as well as a short bio.
## What I learned from this project
Here I experimented a lot, I incorperated a sidebar with navigation purposes.
I found images to use for my background instead of solid colors, learned what kind of images look best for this purpose.
learned a lot about pseudo-classes such as hover and experimented there.
I've become adept at finding and fixing bugs... but I still seem to find them.
